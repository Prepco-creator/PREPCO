                        The Services provided to Members offer discounted access to medical
                        services through Medical Service Providers (MSPs) at designated locations,

                        Medical Service Providers are independent professionals or entities
                        operating in private practice. They are neither employees nor agents of
                        the Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies. This

                        and the relationship between the Company and the MSP is purely
                        transactional.

                        Company will issue a duplicate card for a fee of Rs. 100/- per card (plus
                        applicable taxes). The membership validity will remain unaffected and will
                        be reflected on the replacement card as per the original membership terms.

                        out using your membership until the loss is reported to the helpdesk.

                                guardian consent. In this arrangement, the parent or guardian will be
                                designated as the primary member on behalf of the minor child.
                                However, the parent or guardian will not be eligible to access the
                                plan’s benefits, as these are exclusively intended for the child. The
                                Kids plan is designed to focus on the child’s well-being, with all
                                benefits directed toward them. The role of the parent or guardian is
                                limited to managing and overseeing the plan on behalf of the minor.

                        virtual platform are based on the healthcare practitioner’s professional
                        judgment, and medication will only be prescribed when deemed medically
                        necessary. Schedule X drugs, such as psychotropic or mind-altering
                        substances, will not be prescribed due to their potential for abuse. These
                        services are not intended for medical emergencies, and you should only use
                        them when no other alternatives are available. Some treatments or services
                        may not be suitable for virtual consultations or may be restricted by
                        telemedicine practice guidelines, laws, or regulations. Healthcare

                        To access health check services, you must comply with specific conditions
                        outlined by the provider, ensuring seamless service delivery. These
                        conditions will be communicated to you and must be adhered to in order to
                        benefit from the health check services offered under the program. Payment
                        for health check profiles should be made directly to the respective
                        laboratory at the time of service provision unless otherwise arranged.
                        Note that the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the tests within various
                        profiles may differ between laboratories, which can lead to variations in
                        the savings associated with each profile. The company reserves the right
                        to alter pricing for profiles listed in the membership without prior
                        notice.

                        Upon confirming your appointment, you are required to complete all tests
                        specified in the chosen health check profile at the designated laboratory.
                        Present the profile voucher at the laboratory before availing of the
                        services. Tests will be conducted as per the voucher’s specifications,
                        categorized as test A or test B. Following the voucher redemption, you are
                        responsible for collecting the test reports from the laboratory. The
                        availability of the medical service provider determines the confirmation
                        of your appointment, whether for in-lab services or home collection. If
                        home collection is unavailable in your location, you may need to visit a
                        nearby laboratory as directed by the helpdesk. This process combines
                        payment procedures, test requirements, and service availability
                        conditions, and it is essential to follow these prerequisites to ensure
                        successful service access.

                        By signing this waiver, I acknowledge the inherent risks associated with
                        participating in Zumba, Yoga, or Online Fitness classes, which may include
                        muscle strains, sprains, falls, and cardiovascular complications due to
                        their physically demanding nature, involving aerobic exercise and dance

                        provide real-time corrections or effectively observe my movements.
                        Therefore, I agree to take responsibility for my own safety and exercise
                        caution during online sessions. Additionally, I certify that I am in good
                        physical health and have consulted with a healthcare professional if
                        necessary, ensuring that I am able to safely participate in Zumba or
                        Online Fitness classes without any medical conditions posing a risk.

                        comply with the specified terms and conditions, which govern its proper
                        usage and restrictions. The voucher is strictly limited to the purchase of
                        prescription and over-the-counter medications and cannot be used for
                        non-medical products such as toiletries, cosmetics, or FMCG items. It is
                        applicable exclusively at authorized retail pharmacy outlets and cannot be
                        redeemed at hospital-based pharmacies. This ensures that the voucher is
                        used solely for its intended purpose in the appropriate retail
                        environment.

                        For the fulfillment of prescription-based orders, a valid prescription
                        from a licensed healthcare provider is required. If the order value
                        exceeds the voucher's denomination, you must pay the difference at the
                        time of purchase; if the value is lower, the remaining balance will be
                        forfeited and is not refundable or transferable. All orders must be placed
                        at least seven working days before the voucher’s expiration to ensure
                        timely delivery. The voucher is valid for a single transaction and cannot
                        be combined with other promotions or discounts. You are responsible for
                        any additional delivery or cash-on-delivery (COD) charges, and the company
                        disclaims any liability for discrepancies in medication prices or adverse
                        effects from their use, in accordance with the Indian Drugs and Cosmetics
                        Act, 1940. Order fulfillment is also subject to product availability, and
                        the company is not responsible for any out-of-stock items.

                        The cost of nursing services is determined based on the severity and
                        complexity of the illness or medical condition being addressed. More
                        severe or complicated cases typically incur higher charges due to the
                        additional resources and care required. To access Healthcare@home
                        services, you must contact the Company’s Helpdesk during business hours,
                        from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, excluding national holidays, as some services may
                        not be available on Sundays. Payment for the services is made via debit or
                        credit card directly to the Service Provider, ensuring the funds are
                        deposited into their designated bank account before the services are
                        rendered. Upon submitting your request, a representative will confirm your
                        appointment within 24 working hours, and the designated specialist will
                        visit your provided address. Please note that promotional offers cannot be
                        combined with existing discounts or schemes, and the availability of
                        specialists is subject to their schedules, which may influence appointment
                        timings.
